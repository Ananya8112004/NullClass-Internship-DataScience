# NullClass-Internship-DataScience
This repository contains the tasks completed during my Machine Learning Developer Internship at NullClass (07-07-2025 to 07-09-2025).
The focus of the internship was on grayscale image colorization using deep learning, dataset augmentation, semantic segmentation, and real-time applications.

📝 Tasks Overview
Task 1 – Visualizing the Colorization Process

Visualized intermediate stages from grayscale → partial color → final output.

Helped understand how the model learns color features.

Task 2 – Dataset Augmentation to Improve Colorization

Applied augmentation (rotation, flipping, brightness changes).

Improved robustness and consistency of colorization.

Task 3 – Semantic Segmentation for Targeted Colorisation

Combined segmentation + colorization.

GUI provided for selecting regions to colorize (foreground/background).

Task 4 – Time-Based Historical Image Colorization

Classified photos by era (1900s, 1950s, etc.).

Applied time-specific color palettes for realistic restoration.

GUI allows user to upload photo & choose/override era.

Task 5 – Real-Time Multi-Object Colorization

Real-time video colorization using semantic segmentation.

GUI for uploading webcam/video streams.

Different objects detected and colorized with distinct schemes.

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

Accuracy (≥ 70% achieved)

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

📥 Datasets

Publicly available online datasets were used (e.g., COCO, ADE20K, historical photo archives).

For testing/demo, 2–3 sample grayscale images are included in the images/ folder of each task.
